Irrigation is the artificial application of water to the land or soil. It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and vegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming. Irrigation systems are also used for dust suppression, disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.  In our project, the types of irrigation that will use is localize irrigation which is system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Irrigation using sprinkler systems can also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as traveling sprinklers may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these utilize a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. IOT system will be implementing to monitor the condition of the smart greenhouse and control the temperature could use to collect the data and control the lighting system at night and day.

	Objective
The objectives of our project are:
i.	To control the volume and frequency of irrigation water applied to the agriculture plants with using IOT control.
ii.	To detect changes in water intake rates and decide when and how to compensate by adjusting the irrigation volume or schedule with using IOT to collect the data immediately.
iii.	With using IOT to control the greenhouse system, to prevent irrigation-induced soil and water quality problems such as salinity, soil erosion or leaching of nutrients or pesticides into groundwater.
iv.	To apply embedded system in real life situation from agriculture perspective â€ƒ

Scope
The Greenhouse is only containing for three types of maximum of plants.The technical system is only including temperature control, watering system and fertilizing.Using Wi-Fi system to control the condition and the function of the greenhouse such as the moisture of the soil,temperature of the greenhouse, auto fertilizing of the plants.
